## Disclaimer
All files in the 'static' folder are test files, and all of the JavaScript (JS) and CSS code is contained within the HTML file. This is because I have an extension that allows me to visualize an HTML file in real-time, but it does not work if the code is in a different file. This issue will be addressed in future releases.
